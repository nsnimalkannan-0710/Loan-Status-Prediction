## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on various applicant and loan attributes. The project includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning models for classification and regression
- A user-friendly web interface using Streamlit

---

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizations and statistical summaries
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.
- **Streamlit Web App:** Interactive interface for predicting loan status

---

## Dataset
The dataset used is `loan_data.csv`, which contains the following features:
- Applicant details (age, income, employment status, etc.)
- Loan details (amount, term, interest rate, etc.)
- Target variable: Loan status (Approved/Rejected)

**Note:** Replace this section with the actual columns and a brief description of your dataset.
